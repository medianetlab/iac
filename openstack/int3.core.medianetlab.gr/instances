#
# *** STEP 1: Define the tenant name ***
# Set the "tenant_name" variable to match the OpenStack tenant (project) that your instances are/will be deployed on.
#
# *** STEP 2: Update the instances variable ***
# Update the "instances" variable to create/delete the instances that you want
# To add an instance, add the new instance details in the instances variable mapping. You can find more details for the required fields of each instance below.
# To delete an instance, remove the existing instance details from "instances" variable mapping.

# *** STEP 1: Define the tenant name ***
# This variable must be updated every time to match the OpenStack tenant (project) that your instances are/will be deployed on
# Example:
# tenant_name = "admin"

# *** STEP 2: Update the instances variable ***
# To add an instance, add the new instance details in the "instances" variable mapping. The format must be similar to the example below.
# To delete an instance, remove the existing instance details from "instances" variable mapping.
# instances = {
#     "<INSTANCE_NAME>" = { --> A unique management name for your instance
#       "vm_name"    = "<VM_NAME>" --> The VM name that will be used in OpenStack
#       "image_name" = "<IMAGE_NAME>" --> The image name that will be used for creating the VM
#       "flavor"     = "<FLAVOR_NAME>" --> The flavor name that will be used for creating the VM
#       "networks" = { --> A list with the networks that will be attached to the VM
#         "<NETWORK_NAME>" = { "ip_address" = "<A.B.C.D>" } --> The network name and a static IPv4 do be assigned to the VM, in A.B.C.D format. Leave an empty string in case you want the IP address assigned through DHCP.
#         "<NETWORK_NAME>"  = { "ip_address" = "" }
#       }
#     }
# }
# 
# Example: 
# instances = {
#     "instance2" = {
#       "vm_name"    = "testingVM"
#       "image_name" = "ubuntu20.04"
#       "flavor"     = "5gproxy-flv"
#       "networks" = {
#         "services" = { "ip_address" = "10.161.3.101" }
#         "vnf_net"  = { "ip_address" = "" }
#       }
#     }
# }
